1) Do the following:
a) Open a terminal window and run the following command (to watch for the passwd 
process):
$ watch -n 1 "ps aux | grep passwd"
b) Open another terminal window and run the following command:
$ passwd
c) Look at the first terminal window, you'll see a process come up for passwd.
The first column in the process table is the effective user ID. Lo and behold, 
it's the root user!
